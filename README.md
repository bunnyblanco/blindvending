=============

Data, some documents, and code related to the BEPB Class I took in 2015

The zipped data files are password protected.

The material in the course submodule include my lecture notes.  Since
some of the material was provided after starting the class, I don't
know if I can provide them under an open source license.  I could not
get these material prior to starting the class, so I doubt the State
of Illinois provided it without retaining license/copyright.

The code repository vendexcel is mainly Python code related to some
automation of the process of filling out documents.  The original
intent of the vendrest submodule was to create a web service to allow
for accessible web forms to connect with a database and should
encompass the same material used for the vendexcel forms.

At this point, I will refrain from publishing the submodules.  Both
because I don't know the copyright status of the Course repo and would
like to turn the code in the vendrest repo into an web app to license
to vendors.
